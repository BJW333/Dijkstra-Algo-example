This script implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm a popular shortest path algorithm used in graph theory. It efficiently finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. This is a simple implimentation of the algorithm in python.

	•	Computes the shortest path from a given source node.
	•	Outputs the shortest distances to all other nodes.

If you want to use this example code of the algoritm for something you will need to modify it accordingly.
